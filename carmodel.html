      <h3>Austin A40 Somerset</h3>
      <p>The Austin A40 Somerset is a motor car which was produced by the Austin Motor Company from 1952 until 1954. The Somerset replaced the Austin A40 Devon and, as a body-on-frame car, it was comparable in size to its predecessor. It shared a number of components with the Devon which included a similar 1.2 litre straight-4 pushrod engine. 
        The Somerset's engine was updated to produce 42 hp (31 kW),[5] compared to the Devon's 40 hp (30 kW), giving the car a top speed of 70 mph (110 km/h).</p>

      <h3>Austin 7</h3>
      <p>The Austin 7 is an economy car that was produced from 1923 until 1939 in the United Kingdom by Austin. It was nicknamed the "Baby Austin" and was at that time one of the most popular cars produced for the British market and sold well abroad. Its effect on the British market was similar to that of the Model T Ford in the US, replacing most other British economy cars and cyclecars of the early 1920s.[1] It was also licensed and copied by companies all over the world.

      <h3>Austin A40 Sports</h3>
      <p>The Austin A40 Sports debuted at the 1949 London Motor Show at Earls Court[2] as a four-passenger, aluminium-bodied convertible variant of the Austin A40 – carrying an Austin of England nameplate, bearing Austin's Flying A hood ornament, and designed and manufactured in conjunction with Jensen Motors.

        Production of the A40 Sports, which was intended as a sporty touring car rather than a true sports car,[2] began in November 1950[3] for model year 1951. By the time production ended in 1953, just over 4,000[4] had been manufactured.</p>

      <h3>Austin 16</h3>
      <p>The Austin Sixteen Light Six is a British car that was made by Austin from 1927. Announced in October 1927, the first deliveries were planned for March 1928.[1]

        To distinguish the car from the smaller engined models in the range a plated Austin Six script was fixed to the radiator grille.</p>

  <h3>Austin 12</h3>
  <p>The Austin Twelve was introduced by the Austin Motor Company in 1921. It was the second of Herbert Austin's post World War I models and was in many ways a scaled-down version of his Austin Twenty, introduced in 1919.
     The slower than expected sales of the Twenty brought about this divergence from his intended one-model policy. The Twelve was announced at the beginning of November 1921 after Austin's company had been in receivership for six months. The number twelve refers to its fiscal horse power rather than its bhp which was 20 and later 27. The long stroke engines encouraged by the tax regime, 72 x 102 later 72 x 114.5, had much greater low speed torque than the bhp rating suggests.
