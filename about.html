        <p class="sectionRA text-big">Establisment of the Company</p>
        <p class="sectionRB text-info">The Austin Motor Company Limited was an English manufacturer of motor vehicles, founded in 1905 by Herbert Austin in Longbridge, Birmingham. Austin's mission was to make affordable cars that were reliable and easy to maintain. In 1906, the company produced its first car, the Austin 25/30, which quickly became popular in the UK due to its affordability and reliability. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the company continued to expand, producing a range of cars to suit different needs and budgets.
            During World War II, Austin Motor Company produced military vehicles, including the famous "Austin K2/Y" ambulance used by the British Army. After the war, the company resumed car production and continued to innovate, producing the popular Austin Mini in 1959, which went on to become one of the most iconic British cars of all time.
         </p>
        <P class="sectionRB text-info">The business combined with Morris Motors in 1952 to create the British Motor Corporation. (BMC). In 1968, BMC and Leyland Motor Corporation combined to become British Leyland, which later joined the Rover Group. Austin Motors' heritage is still alive today because to classic automobile collectors and the enduring appeal of their famous cars.
